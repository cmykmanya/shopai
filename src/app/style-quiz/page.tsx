1. Have the same `'use client'` directive
2. Have the same Next.js export declarations (`dynamic` and `revalidate`)
3. Import the exact same dependencies in the same order
4. Have identical formatting

Since there are no changes to apply, your original code is already in the suggested form. No modifications are needed.
